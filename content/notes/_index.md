This is the notes section. It is for mere thoughts. Nothing here is final.

Sections
========

## [The Creating Child Notes]({{< ref "notes/_index.md" >}})

The framework comprises (at least) three parts, tentatively identified as:

### [Background]({{< ref "notes/background/_index.md" >}})

AKA, the philosophy, the moral vision.

### [Substance]({{< ref "notes/substance/_index.md" >}})

AKA the approach itself, *what it is*

### [Implementation]({{< ref "notes/implementation/_index.md" >}})

AKA detailed guidance, FAQs, troubleshooting, specifics, examples, etc

### [Bibliography]({{< ref "notes/bibliography/_index.md" >}})


## [The Salon]({{< ref "notes/other_projects/salon.md" >}})

## [The Workshop]({{< ref "notes/other_projects/workshop.md" >}})
