## Some Early Questions


### Why Me?

I'm especially concerned with:
- dignity
- agency
- creation rather than consumption
- people being allowed to become fully themselves instead of being forced into institutional shapes
- meaning as something lived, not merely theorized
- coherence between what we say we value and what we actually structure our lives around


### What is the Question We're Actually Trying to Answer, the Problem We Actually Want to Solve?

Here's one: How do children live meaningful lives *now*, not later?

Children are:
- present beings, not merely future adults
- contributors, not trainees
- creators, not vessels

Children deserve to experience themselves as contributors to reality, not merely as future applicants


### What is the Framework *For*?

To answer questions like:

- What do we do when the child doesn't know what to do?
- How do we measure progress without killing freedom?
- (And what constitutes progress?)
- How do we protect *creation* from becoming *obligation*?
- How do we explain this to skeptics?
- How do we know *we're* not just beign lazy or chaotic?


### What Common Parent Experiences Are We Addressing?

- "My kid is bored but not lazy"
- "My child is bright but seems disconnected"
- "School feels hollow but I can't articulate why"
- "Homeschooling feels freer but sometimes directionless"
- "I want my child to matter, not just perform"


### What is [The Salon]({{< ref "notes/other_projects/salon.md" >}}) For?

- Where ideas breathe
- Where they're stress-tested
- Where people stop feeling alone

A space for:
- seriousness without rigidity
- curiosity without dogma
- disagreement without hostility
- imagination without embarrassment


### What is [The Workshop]({{< ref "notes/other_projects/workshop.md" >}}) For?

A place where:
- children build
- adults *assist* rather than command
- projects matter
- mess is allowed
- time is deep
- curiosity has weight


## Other Questions to Think About

- What do I believe education is for?
- What do I reject and why?
- What do I notice working?
- What feels wrong?
- What children actually need in moments of confusion
- What creation looks like at different ages (5, 8, 10, etc)
- What dignity looks like at different ages
- What agency looks like at those ages
- How can this change a child's day?
- What would this look like in... a kitchen? a garage? a garden? etc
- How would this make a life more real?


## Everyday Questions

- Where is my child adding value?
- What feels real to them right now?
- What would make today significant?
- What could they build, fix, serve, or shape?
