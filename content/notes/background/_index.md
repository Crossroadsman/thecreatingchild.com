Some Early Questions
====================

Why Me?
-------

I'm especially concerned with:
- dignity
- agency
- creation rather than consumption
- people being allowed to become fully themselves instead of being forced into institutional shapes
- meaning as something lived, not merely theorized
- coherence between what we say we value and what we actually structure our lives around

I care about *fertile systems*, about creating environments where something genuinely new, valuable and autonomous can emerge without being distorted, exploited, or crushed by existing power structures. About stewardship rather than control.

I'm not trying to shape outcomes but conditions.

I'm not anti-learning, I'm anti-systemic flattening. I'm opposed to institutions that optimize for compliance, standardization, and throughput at the expense of agency, curiosity, and depth.

I believe in:
- systems that reward exploration over obedience
- environments that trust families

Unschooling is fundamentally the flavour of established homeschooling that I find most compelling and consistent with the ideals of homeschooling. But even I sometimes find it so unstructured as to be paralyzing (and pity those, like my long-suffering wife, who leans more towards the school-at-home conception of homeschooling). It seems like there's a gap for something that helps parents who are sympathetic to unschooling find a way to navigate it while at the same time having something to help assess progress, especially when the child themselves is feeling directionless.

It's been said that "unschooling without any scaffolding can feel like being dropped in the middle of the ocean and told 'swim wherever you like'. That's freedom, but it's also terrifying. Some children thrive in that, some freeze, some drift, and many oscillate between bursts of curiosity and long stretches of disorientation. Parents feel it too: am I honoring autonomy, or am I abandoning guidance?"


What Can I Contribute?
----------------------

Something like:
- building resource networks for homeschoolers
- creating curricula that emphasize coherence, philosophy, and wonder
- developing platforms that connect families seeking depth
- documenting what works, so other can copy or build upon without reinvention
- acting as a translator between "outsiders" and homeschooling families to reduce suspicion

All look like *stewardship*: building gardens, not factories.


What is the Question We're Actually Trying to Answer, the Problem We Actually Want to Solve?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here's one: How do children live meaningful lives *now*, not later?

Children are:
- present beings, not merely future adults
- full moral agents
    - they care deeply,
    - they suffer real losses,
    - they experience pride, shame, loyalty, betrayal, wonder...
    - they form values,
    - they notice (and experience) injustice,
    - they want to **matter**
- contributors, not trainees
- creators, not vessels

Children deserve to experience themselves as contributors to reality, not merely as future applicants


What is the Framework *For*?
----------------------------

To answer questions like:

- What do we do when the child doesn't know what to do?
- How do we measure progress without killing freedom?
- (And what constitutes progress?)
- How do we protect *creation* from becoming *obligation*?
- How do we explain this to skeptics?
- How do we know *we're* not just being lazy or chaotic?

To serve goals such as:

- preserving (and maximising) agency
- providing orientation
- making growth visible → and note that we shouldn't want to be asking "Are you learning?" so much as "Are you experiencing your own unfolding?"
- build fluency in things like:
  - self-perception
  - internal navigation
  - gentle commitment
  - reversible action
  - trusting emergence


What is the Moral Vision?
-------------------------

- What is a child?
  - full moral agents
    - they care deeply,
    - they suffer real losses,
    - they experience pride, shame, loyalty, betrayal, wonder...
    - they form values,
    - they notice (and experience) injustice,
    - they want to **matter**
- What is childhood for?

- Children are already living real lives.
- Childhood is not instrumental.
- Agency precedes instruction.
- Meaning comes before measurement.
- Creation matters more than consumption.

An important aspect of a child-respecting education or development system, something that even Unschooling sometimes ignores or under-appreciates, is that education is a system that takes 15 to 20 years of a young person's life (the years when they have the most imagination, energy, creativity, risk tolerance, free time, neuroplasticity, emotional intensity, novelty-seeking, and openness) and promises in exchange to give them knowledge. Even the best homeschooling systems implicitly make this trade. And perhaps it is a poor bargain. Perhaps more focus during those years should be on supporting the young person to accomplish something they care about, not in terms of credentials, but in terms of putting something into the world. Adding to the stock of the world's wealth (for want of a better term) and building something for and of oneself. "Learning", as popularly understood, is at most a side-effect of that.

**Adding to the world is how humans discover who they are**


### Why it Matters

A child who grows up experiencing herself as a cause:
- doesn't need to be coerced to learn
- doesn't collapse when structures change
- doesn't outsource her worth to institutions
- doesn't confuse obedience with goodness
- doesn't equate value with performance

She becomes:
- internally motivated
- psychologically sturdy
- creatively alive
- morally serious
- difficult to dominate



What Common Parent Experiences Are We Addressing?
-------------------------------------------------

- "My kid is bored but not lazy"
- "My child is bright but seems disconnected"
- "School feels hollow but I can't articulate why"
- "Homeschooling feels freer but sometimes directionless"
- "I want my child to matter, not just perform"


What is [The Salon]({{< ref "notes/other_projects/salon.md" >}}) For?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

- Where ideas breathe
- Where they're stress-tested
- Where people stop feeling alone

A space for:
- seriousness without rigidity
- curiosity without dogma
- disagreement without hostility
- imagination without embarrassment


What is [The Workshop]({{< ref "notes/other_projects/workshop.md" >}}) For?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

A place where:
- children build
- adults *assist* rather than command
- projects matter
- mess is allowed
- time is deep
- curiosity has weight


On "Learning"
-------------

Under this framework, learning isn't the point. But (the right) learning is valuable.

**Knowledge is inert without purpose**

When we invert the relationship between learning and purpose (instead of "learn alegebra so you can one day do..." we say, "you want to build *X*? Let's learn what you need..."):
- learning becomes instrumentally meaningful
- effort becomes voluntary
- difficulty becomes justified
- competence becomes visible
- identity forms around *agency*, not compliance

The child ceases to be a *student*, a vessel for knowledge, and instead is a *creator*, a *maker*, a *contributor*.


Other Questions to Think About
==============================

- What do I believe education is for?
- What do I reject and why?
- What do I notice working?
- What feels wrong?
- What children actually need in moments of confusion
- What creation looks like at different ages (5, 8, 10, etc)
- What dignity looks like at different ages
- What agency looks like at those ages
- How can this change a child's day?
- What would this look like in... a kitchen? a garage? a garden? etc
- How would this make a life more real?


Everyday Questions
==================

- Where is my child adding value?
- What feels real to them right now?
- What would make today significant?
- What could they build, fix, serve, or shape?
