Bibliography
============

## Completed


### John Taylor Gatto: Weapons of Mass Instruction
(note that chapter refs might be off in the audible version vs the paper version)

History of compulsory/standardised ed in USA (Ch. 2?)

David Sarnoff, a significant life at age 10 - about 1/4 into Ch. 5

Dumbness used to be mere ignorance - about 40% into Ch. 6
- dumbness used to be mere ignorance but schooling has created a categorically different kind of dumbness. A sort of dumbness that creates a veneer of intellect around a mind that's utterly, and obliviously, inert
- schooling produces people who look competent, sound articulate, and function smoothly inside systems, while being almost entirely disconnected from first-principles reasoning, moral independence, or creative initiative.

Reference to "Open Source Learning" (throughout)


### John Holt and Pat Farenga: Teach Your Own: The Indispensable Guide to Living and Learning with Children at Home

Learning Pods

Even very young children are free to choose their own actions: to play, to explore, to participate. To Take on meaningful responsibility. Learning is not conceived as a special activity at all, but as a natural byproduct of being alive in the world. (about 25% into Ch. 2)


Meeting/Living/Doing; "not primarily a place for children" - Chapter 5

Play - Chapter 6

Work - Chapter 9(?) generally
