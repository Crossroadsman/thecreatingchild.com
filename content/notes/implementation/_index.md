Addressing the "I Don't Know What To Do" Problem
------------------------------------------------

This is where freedom either becomes generative or collapes into anxiety. Traditional schooling solves that problem by annihilating it: you're told what to do, when to do it, how long to do it, how well you did, and by what standards. Unschooling refuses that 'solution' but still has to answer the psychological reality that human beings, especially children, are not endlessly self-directing engines. We all need orientation, traction.

"I don't know what to do" doesn't mean the child lacks motivation. Often in means the child lacks a frame, or context, to answer the question of what to do. It's not apathy, it's disorientation. It's overload.

So "I don't know what to do" needs to be a signal, not a failure. A signal that the child needs a different kind of support than content delivery, they need a way to locate or orient themselves.

One way to do that is by offering gentle, dimensional questions (links to Substance page). Not questions about content (like, "Do you want to learn trigonometry?") but about orientation, like:
- Do you feel like using your body or your mind right now?
- Do you want something calm or exciting?
- Do you want to make something or understand something?
- Do you want to be alone or with someone?
- Do you want something short or something deep?

This helps turn the problem from "what is demanded of me?" into "what is alive in me right now?"

Another layer is helping children recognize patterns in themselves over time. Often, when a kid says "I don't know what to do" they actually mean:
- I'm afraid to choose wrong
- I'm overwhelmed
- I don't want to start something that feels big
- I want stimulation but not commitment

And we can reduce the weight of these choices by suggesting things like:
- Do you want to try something for five minutes?
- Do you want to poke at something without finishing it?
- Do you want to gather materials but not make anything yet?

Action doesn't have to be total or permanent, it can be exploratory (a lesson that's valuable for adults, too).
