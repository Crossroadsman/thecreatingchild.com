The Workshop
============

A physical space for homeschoolers to work and play and explore and meet each other and have a shared space for projects, ideally with adult volunteers at hand to assist with whatever the kids want to pursue


What is The Workshop For?
-------------------------

A place where:
- children build
- adults *assist* rather than command
- projects matter
- mess is allowed
- time is deep
- curiosity has weight
