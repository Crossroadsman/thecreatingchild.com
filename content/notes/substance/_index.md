Substance
=========

### What *Is* the Framework?

- Qualitative not quantitative
- Reflective not prescriptive
- Adpative not fixed
- Relational not linear

#### What It Isn't

##### A Homeschool Method

At least, not merely a homeschool method. This is a vision of child relations that facilitates and reinforces the child's instinct that "My existence alters the world". Everything else grows from that:
- reading
- maths
- science
- discipline
- ethics
- work

##### A Curriculum

The word *curriculum* has always meant something structured. From the earliest use in Latin as "the course of a race" to its importation into the educational context in the 16th century it represented fixed order and structure.

We reject coercive structure, not meaningful structure: humans still need orientation, narrative and feedback, even when freed. But these structures do not need to be fixed or imposed.

When we provide structure we build it around growth, not compliance.


##### A Syllabus

A syllabus typically defines expectations and responsibilities.

Instead we provide more of a map and compass: we don't tell the child where to go, but communicate the terrain, how movement works, points of interest, how to know where you are.

Instead of subjects we might describe domains of experience, like:
- communication (language, storytelling, adgument, listening)
- exploration (science, nature, tinkering, observation)
- creation (art, building, writing, coding, cooking)
- systems (math, logic, economics, games, strategy)
- selfhood (emotions, relationships, ethics, identity)
- worldhood (history, culture, geography, power, institutions)
