Substance
=========

**What It Is**

AKA, the conceptual translation—what learning, agency and guidance mean in practice. It answers the question: "If I remove school, what replaces its organizing function?" (?)

How the philosophy becomes homeschooling in practice.

Answers the question: "If I accept your vision of childhood, what does a day actually look like?"


### What *Is* the Framework?

- Qualitative not quantitative
- Reflective not prescriptive
- Adaptive not fixed
- Relational not linear

#### What It Isn't

##### A Homeschool Method

At least, not merely a homeschool method. This is a vision of child relations that facilitates and reinforces the child's instinct that "My existence alters the world". Everything else grows from that:
- reading
- maths
- science
- discipline
- ethics
- work

##### A Curriculum

The word *curriculum* has always meant something structured. From the earliest use in Latin as "the course of a race" to its importation into the educational context in the 16th century it represented fixed order and structure.

We reject coercive structure, not meaningful structure: humans still need orientation, narrative and feedback, even when freed. But these structures do not need to be fixed or imposed.

When we provide structure we build it around growth, not compliance.


##### A Syllabus

A syllabus typically defines expectations and responsibilities.

Instead we provide more of a map and compass: we don't tell the child where to go, but communicate the terrain, how movement works, points of interest, how to know where you are.

Instead of subjects we might describe domains of experience, like:
- communication (language, storytelling, adgument, listening)
- exploration (science, nature, tinkering, observation)
- creation (art, building, writing, coding, cooking)
- systems (math, logic, economics, games, strategy)
- selfhood (emotions, relationships, ethics, identity)
- worldhood (history, culture, geography, power, institutions)


### Dimensions

What are the dimensions of a child's engagement with the world?
- curiosity
- agency
- solidarity
- mastery
- play
- meaning-making
- responsibility


### Modes

What are the modes a day can take?
- exploration
- rest
- repetition
- invention
- social connection
- absorption
- chaos


### Engagement States

Offer a taxonomy or small vocabulary of recognizable states, e.g.:
- absorbed creation (building, inventing, pretending, drawing, structuring)
- exploratory wandering (trying, sampling, touching, abandoning)
- skill deepening (repeating, refining, practicing)
- social meaning-making (role-play, storytelling, negotiation)
- rest/incubation (boredom, lying around, doing "nothing")
- distress/overload (dysregulation, frustration, collapse)

Give guidance for each:
- what it means
- what not to interrupt
- when to support
- when to step back
- when to intervene

It tells parents: "This is intelligible. You are not floating in chaos"


### Rhythms

Giving time shape without schedules. 
Describe:
- daily rhythms (energy rises/falls)
- weekly rhythms
- seasonal rhythms
- attention cycles
Predictability without rigidity.


### Bits and Pieces

"A meeting, living, doing place" (see e.g., Teach Your Own Ch. 5) and cf "not primarily a place for children". What are the pros and cons of places that are designed *for* children to maximise their agency and places that are built without regard to age where children can observe, join, assist adults in real endeavours?

The importance of play (see, e.g., Teach Your Own Ch. 6)
