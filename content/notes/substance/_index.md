### What *Is* the Framework?

#### What It Isn't

##### A Curriculum

The word *curriculum* has always meant something structured. From the earliest use in Latin as "the course of a race" to its importation into the educational context in the 16th century it represented fixed order and structure.

We reject coercive structure, not meaningful structure: humans still need orientation, narrative and feedback, even when freed. But these structures do not need to be fixed or imposed.
