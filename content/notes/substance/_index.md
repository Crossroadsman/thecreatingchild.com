Overview
========

**What It Is**

AKA, the conceptual translation—what learning, agency and guidance mean in practice. It answers the question: "If I remove school, what replaces its organizing function?" (?)

How the philosophy becomes homeschooling in practice.

Answers the question: "If I accept your vision of childhood, what does a day actually look like?"


What *Is* the Framework?
------------------------

- Qualitative not quantitative
- Reflective not prescriptive
- Adaptive not fixed
- Relational not linear

Should do (perhaps among other things) three things simultaneously:
- preserve (and maximize) agency;
- provide orientation; and
- make growth visible.


### What It Isn't

#### A Homeschool Method

At least, not merely a homeschool method. This is a vision of child relations that facilitates and reinforces the child's instinct that "My existence alters the world". Everything else grows from that:
- reading
- maths
- science
- discipline
- ethics
- work

#### A Curriculum

The word *curriculum* has always meant something structured. From the earliest use in Latin as "the course of a race" to its importation into the educational context in the 16th century it represented fixed order and structure.

We reject coercive structure, not meaningful structure: humans still need orientation, narrative and feedback, even when freed. But these structures do not need to be fixed or imposed.

When we provide structure we build it around growth, not compliance.


#### A Syllabus

A syllabus typically defines expectations and responsibilities.

Instead we provide more of a map and compass: we don't tell the child where to go, but communicate the terrain, how movement works, points of interest, how to know where you are.

Instead of subjects we might describe domains of experience, like:
- communication (language, storytelling, adgument, listening)
- exploration (science, nature, tinkering, observation)
- creation (art, building, writing, coding, cooking)
- systems (math, logic, economics, games, strategy)
- selfhood (emotions, relationships, ethics, identity)
- worldhood (history, culture, geography, power, institutions)


Components
==========


Dimensions
----------

What are the dimensions of a child's engagement with the world?
- curiosity
- agency
- solidarity
- mastery
- play
- meaning-making
- responsibility


Modes
-----

What are the modes a day can take?
- exploration
- rest
- repetition
- invention
- social connection
- absorption
- chaos


Non-Curriculum Map
------------------

Explicitly name what fills the curriculum slot.
Instead of math, science, English, map:
- symbolic play
- narrative construction
- quantitative intuition
- causal reasoning
- tool use
- social modeling
- aesthetic experimentation

Show how these emerge naturally through creation → Reassures that nothing essential is being neglected, only reframed.



Engagement States
-----------------

Offer a taxonomy or small vocabulary of recognizable states, e.g.:
- absorbed creation (building, inventing, pretending, drawing, structuring)
- exploratory wandering (trying, sampling, touching, abandoning)
- skill deepening (repeating, refining, practicing)
- social meaning-making (role-play, storytelling, negotiation)
- rest/incubation (boredom, lying around, doing "nothing")
- distress/overload (dysregulation, frustration, collapse)

Give guidance for each:
- what it means
- what not to interrupt
- when to support
- when to step back
- when to intervene

It tells parents: "This is intelligible. You are not floating in chaos"


Rhythms
-------

Giving time shape without schedules. 
Describe:
- daily rhythms (energy rises/falls)
- weekly rhythms
- seasonal rhythms
- attention cycles
Predictability without rigidity.



Signals
-------

What are the signals something is working?
- longer attention
- voluntary return
- increased confidence
- spontaneous elaboration
- resilience after frustration


Role Redefinitions
------------------

Not: teacher/instructor/manager/evaluator
but:
- steward of environment
- curator of affordances
- interpreter of signals
- guardian of psychological safety

Contrast:

| School Logic      | Creation-First Logic  |
|-------------------|-----------------------|
| Deliver Content   | → Shape Conditions    |
| Measure Outcomes  | → Observe Engagement  |
| Correct Errors    | → Support Exploration |
| Control Behaviour | → Protect Agency      |



Substitutes to School Structures
--------------------------------

School provides structures:
- temporal (days, weeks, terms/semesters, years)
- moral (this is what matters)
- epistemic (this is what knowledge is)
- authority (this is who decides)

Thus the framework must provide ways to think about:
- time
- progress
- intervention
- stagnation
- responsibility

Instead of grades:
- depth of engagement
- increasing authorship
- resilience after frustration
- ability to start things
- ability to abandon things without collapse

Instead of subjects:
- domains of creation
  - making
  - imagining
  - organizing
  - exploring
  - relating

Instead of lesson plans:
- invitations
- environments
- materials
- rhythms
- rituals



Environmental Design Principles
-------------------------------

Instead of lesson plans, provide design constraints:
- material richness beats instruction
- accessibility beats explanation
- tools beat toys
- open-ended objects beat closed systems
- visible adult work beats chilld-only spaces

Outline categories:
- physical space
- materials
- time structure
- social exposure
- adult presence

"If the environment is doing most of the work, the parent doesn't need to."


Bits and Pieces
===============

"A meeting, living, doing place" (see e.g., Teach Your Own Ch. 5) and cf "not primarily a place for children". What are the pros and cons of places that are designed *for* children to maximise their agency and places that are built without regard to age where children can observe, join, assist adults in real endeavours?

The importance of play (see, e.g., Teach Your Own Ch. 6)
